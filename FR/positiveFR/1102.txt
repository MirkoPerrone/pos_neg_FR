it charges each of my devices (smartphone and tablet) with the most adapted voltage. I can charge my galaxy s2 3 times and my nexus 7 one time with one load... and faster than with the wall plug... the led lamp is a real plus. You realize it's a quality product in every aspect once you get it in your hand. This battery never leaves my pocket as it's compact and sleek. I hope i'll be allowed to take this battery, now indispensable, as cabin luggage when travelling by plane, as I don't know if they accept lithium batteries for safety reasons..
