Really cheap solution for geolocating. Compatible with VPN services such as IPVanish and PrivateInternetAccess after firmware upgrade to DD-WRT. I set them up using WAN PPTP mode. Serves up WiFi at 7 to 10Mbps from Chicago and New York. FWIW, I prefer IPVanish because PrivateInternetAccess has bizarre routing (FR-NL-UK-FR). So cheap, I bought a router for each geolocation. I just select the desired SSID and Bob's your uncle.
