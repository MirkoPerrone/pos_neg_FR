These are excellent little micro USB cables. They do exactly what you would expect, and are well made, so I expect they will last a good long time. Good retention force in all the devices I've used them with, and no compatibility/continuity problems even in some of my older devices that have issues with other cables. I picked these because I wanted to avoid having to coil up cables for short runs. If that's what you are looking for, these will fit the bill.
