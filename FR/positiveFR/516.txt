First, I'd like to say it is a good mobile battery for my iPhone. Basically, it can recharge my iPhone from 5% to more than 95% battery capacity, however it is only one time. It's good enough for daily life but not enough powerful for a 2-day travelling during which no time to recharge the mobile battery. Another thing, it becomes very hot when recharging my iPhone.
