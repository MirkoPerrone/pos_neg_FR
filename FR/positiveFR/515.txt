My husband bought it first (for his HTC One) and it worked so good that I had to get me one. It's easy to use and I always carry it with me on my purse. At the moment I have a Samsung S3 and has worked perfectly, now I need to test it with my newly acquired S6 to see it's performance with it. In the S3 it took me a bit over an hour to get it charged from 25% to 100%.
