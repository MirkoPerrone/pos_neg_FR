I have used it for a couple of days, and it works pretty well. Use it on an iPhone, that has a small battery (~1400mah), and it can recharge the phone two times. It doesn't take a lot of time, I would say more or less the same as when you plug your phone to the normal charger. The battery takes 2,3 hours to recharge, with normal phone charger. I highly recommend this product
