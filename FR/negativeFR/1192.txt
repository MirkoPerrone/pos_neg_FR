"This thing has a one day battery life if you use it with Calibre or have non-Amazon ebooks. A function called the indexer gets regularly stuck in a loop indexing new books put on the device. This blunder that has been present for multiple years and which should be trivial to fix is not adressed at all, the only ""solution"" provided is all kinds of badly working or very labor intensive workarounds. It means the thing is pretty useless as a standalone device since it needs recharging every day."
