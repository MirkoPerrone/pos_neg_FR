Unfortunately the image of the adapter does not correspond to the one sold. The adapter sold is the very fragile EURO TG01 with only 10A of maximum power. It is written on it that it is only a temporary solution avoiding any liability. Besides it is a massive big square. Conclusion, it is a travel adapter for someone who needs a little bit of power like a computer, radio or shaving maching and not an adapter for your domestic appliance. I have an adapter exactly as the one in the picture with a 16A of maximum power, capable of resisting heat and power. Go for any other adapter, the one sold here is just for your computer when you go to continent from the UK.
