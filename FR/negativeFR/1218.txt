"I love the paperwhite but I am so annoyed by the fact that I can not turn the light completely off. It seams a lot of people, like myself have sensitive eyes and are still able to see the light even at the lowest settings.There is a way but you have to jailbreak your device and hack it yourself. And then, you wont be able to update it... the line of code is simple: * * * * * var=$(cat /sys/devices/system/fl_tps6116x/fl_tps6116x0/fl_intensity | grep -e '[0-9]'); if [ ""$var"" = ""FrontLight(Intensity) = 1"" ]; then echo -n 0 > /sys/devices/system/fl_tps6116x/fl_tps6116x0/fl_intensity; fi Common Amazon, I did not buy an Ipad because I hate to read with a backlight, don't sell me an ebook reader with a backlight that I cant turn off!!"
